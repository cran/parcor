--- Version 0.2-6 (September 04, 2014)

Updated maintainer's email address.

--- Version 0.2-5 (August 13, 2014)

- In the functions mylars, adalasso and adalasso.net, it can be specified if an intercept should be included in the model or not.
- Bug fix: The function ridge.cv can also be applied if there is only a single predictor variable. Intead of lm.ridge, which produced   an error message, it calls the new function lm.ridge.univariate.

--- Version 0.2-4 (August 20, 2013) ---

- The function adalasso is now compatible with the latest version of the glmnet package.
